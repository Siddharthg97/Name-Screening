    "Objective : Information retrieval using Question Answering model about crimes commited and when was the crimes committed.\n",

    "Conclusion : ConversationalRetrievalChain was performing best,as it was able to extract correct answers for most of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation & approach : \n",
    "Applying a for loop for each report in biography section\n",
    "1)Documents creation\n",
    "2)Splitting it into chunks - Now used tokentextsplitter to create chunks because the chunk size should not exceed token limit of llm model.Kept chunk size 300 with overalp of 50 tokens.So mostly the complete document was created as one chunk.(Normally the approach for each chunk they should contain specific unique information.So we can use semantic chunks or some manual obersvation that after 4-5 lines specify one particular information, hence chunk size should decide based on that).\n",
    "3)Need to create embeddings for chunks and store them using vector database. So use OllamaEmbeddings and Store in FAISS\n",
    "4)Now we need to retrieve only relevant chunks based on query we pass, so there are many retrievers to compare against likve vector store , contextualcompression , multi query etc. Need to check there out put cunks based on query we provide.In our case since there was only one chunk being prepared every time hence there is no impact on retrievers .We used vector store as retriever \n",
    "5)Now we have 3 qa chains to compare performance - Retrieval QA Chain , Conversationa Retrieval Chain , Load qa chain. Out of which Conversationa Retrieval Chain was getting good answers among all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6)Used prompt template to get defined answers to two questions asked.For instance, model should predict answers in few words and if doesn't get answers it should provide cobtext in few line\n",
